# CHESS FLIP

Chess Flip Game is a blockchain-based memory matching game built with React and Solidity, deployed on the Lisk Sepolia Testnet. Players connect their MetaMask wallet, pay 0.001 ETH to play, and match pairs of chess piece cards (e.g., ♟, ♞, ♝, ♜, ♛, ♚). The game tracks lives (4 attempts) and rewards players with 0.002 ETH for matching all 10 pairs (win) or 0.0005 ETH for losing all lives. The smart contract ensures secure gameplay, reward distribution, and leaderboard tracking.
